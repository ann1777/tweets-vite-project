3. The final user's actions result should be recorded. F.e. if you click on the button and refresh the page, the button should still remains in the Following state and with the appropriate color, and the followers number doesn't decreases to the initial value.

4. When you click the button again, its text and color change to their initial state. Also the followers number decreases by 1 after that (100.500).
